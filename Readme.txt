This is my second project in learning Python, I want to learn about coding more, specifically on setting conditions.
Here are my objectives and if you're inspired, you can also follow these instructions so that you don't get lost when coding:
    1. Use "input()"" to gather words from the user.
        - The inputs must be STRINGS

    2. Store the inputs in Variables.
        a. Store the inputs for the Nouns
        b. Store the inputs for the Verbs
        c. Store the inputs for the Adjectives

    3. Insert the User's inputs into a Story
        a. Create dialogue that requires words to make it humorous
        b. Use f-string format to insert the User's input into the story
        c. Print out the result

Congratulations! Now you have a game. But, it is not fully complete yet, here are the things you can do to make improve it:

    4. Add a player system (After player 1 is finished with the sentence, the code moves to the next player)
        a. Add a player system
        b.

    5.
